## About

Loconote is a document type that combines rich text with code, inspired by projects like [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Loconote uses a visual code editor to lower the required level of the user's programming skills. The goal is to broaden the use of such [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) tools and to make them available to students and non-programmers.

Loconote takes the form of a JavaScript library that can be embedded into websites.


## Usage

The project is in very early development and thus far only suited for expermental use. Many features are still missing. Expect the file format and API to change a lot. When its stable, it will be released as an npm package. For now, you can play with the test pages linked above.
